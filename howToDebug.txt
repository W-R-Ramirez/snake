Step 1:
Run 
python debug.py
on your terminal.

Step 2: 
press the four arrow keys and note
the values being printed out on your 
terminal when you press each button

When you are done, exit the gray box
which opened. 

Step 3:
Go into snake.py in your favorite
text editor and edit the lines 135-142
from :
if repr(event.keycode) == "111":
        game.turn_snake("N")
    elif repr(event.keycode) == "114":
        game.turn_snake("E")
    elif repr(event.keycode) == "113":
        game.turn_snake("W")
    elif repr(event.keycode) == "116":
        game.turn_snake("S")

so that the numbers in the "" are the numbers 
that were printed out in step two. 

The first number corresponds to the UP key
The second number corresponds to the RIGHT key
the third number corresponds to the LEFT key
the fourth number corresponds to the DOWN key
